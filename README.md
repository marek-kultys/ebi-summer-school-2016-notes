**Genome Assembly project** is inspired by [this paper](http://www.pnas.org/content/109/8/3065.full.pdf) reporting on the E. Coli outbreak in Germany and France in 2011. We will be using the data produced by the team behind the paper. Project outline available online on [EBI Summer School Google Folder](http://goo.gl/m7F6rT).
